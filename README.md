# DesignPatterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

_Simple implementations of some common patterns in C#._

## Creational
- **Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- **Factory** Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Singleton** is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.

## Structural
- **Proxy** is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

- **Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Behavioural
- **Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
